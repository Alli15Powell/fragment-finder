Fragment Finder (FF) & TSV Merger  Fragment Finder is a PyQt5 desktop app for discovering over-represented short RNA fragments in NGS data. Given a read set and a reference FASTA, FF maps reads with a fast Ahoâ€“Corasick core (Cython) to build positional coverage across longer RNAs, calls enrichment peaks, and exports publication-ready tables. Plots are rendered with matplotlib inside the GUI.  Under the hood, FF:  Parses FASTA/FASTQ with Biopython and normalizes signal as Reads-per-Million (RPM).  Detects peaks using scipy.signal.find_peaks with data-driven thresholds.  Estimates significance via a permutation-based background to report p-values and Z-scores.  Writes a .tsv with: ID, RPM, Peak Start/End, Peak Sequence, Permutation P-Value, Z-score, Total Reads, and Source File.  Performance comes from a compiled Cython extension (Procedure.pyx) that accelerates pattern matching and sliding computations, while Util.py encapsulates the peak-calling and export logic. A packaged Windows executable is supported via PyInstaller, but source-first workflows are encouraged.  The companion TSV Merger tool streamlines downstream analysis by concatenating multiple FF result files into a single table and optionally annotating rows with possible database origins. This makes cross-sample comparisons and QC much easier without manual spreadsheet work.  Highlights  Friendly GUI: select inputs, run, visualize peaks, export results.  Reproducible outputs with clear statistics (RPM, p-values, Z-scores).  Fast core in Cython; Python glue for readability and extension.  Utilities for multi-run merging and origin checking.  Ideal for small-RNA discovery, ncRNA fragment profiling, and exploratory validation pipelines.
